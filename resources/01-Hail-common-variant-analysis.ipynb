    "1) Use simple python code and Jupyter notebooks.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### It doesn't all need to \"stick\" today\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical contains a lot of new material, and the goal of this workbook is not for you to be able to reproduce from memory all the various capabilities demonstrated here. Instead, the goal is for you to get a sense for the kind of analysis tasks that sequencing data requires, and to gain some exposure to what these analyses look like in Hail. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no one-size-fits-all sequencing analysis pipeline, because each sequencing dataset will have unique properties that need to be understood and accounted for in QC and analysis. Hail can empower you to interrogate sequencing data, but it cannot give you all the questions to ask!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the questions and exercises in this notebook might seem unrelated to the specific task of analyzing sequencing data, but that is intentional -- Hail is a computational tool that hopes to help you indulge your scientific curiosity, and asking and answering a variety of questions about many aspects of your data is the best way to learn *how to Hail*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't expect you to be able to run a full GWAS on your own data in Hail tomorrow. If this is something you want to do, there are **lots more** resources available -- documentation, cookbooks, tutorials, and most importantly, the Hail community on the [forum](https://discuss.hail.is) and [zulip chatroom](https://hail.zulipchat.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "### We encourage you to play\n",
    "\n",
    "Hail is a highly expressive library with lots of functionality -- you'll see just a small fraction of it today. Throughout this notebook and especially in the denoted **exercises**, we encourage you to experiment with the code being run to see what happens! Sometimes it will be an error, but sometimes you will encounter new pieces of functionality. If you're curious about how to use Hail to ask slightly different questions than the code or exercises here, please ask the faculty! We are eager to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive analysis on the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what we think is so exciting about Hail is that Hail development has coincided with other technological shifts in the data science community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five years ago, most computational biologists analyzed sequencing data using command-line tools, and took advantage of research compute clusters by explicitly using scheduling frameworks like LSF or Sun Grid Engine. These clusters are powerful resources, but it requires a great deal of extra thought and effort to manage pipelines running on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most Hail users run Hail from within interactive Python notebooks (like this one!) backed by thousands of cores on public compute clouds like [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/). You don't need to share a cluster with hundreds of other scientists, and you only need to pay for the resources that you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't get hands-on experience with this kind of usage today, but there are lots of resources to help you get started if you're interested in that. Please stay in touch with us after the workshop ends!"

    " - `MatrixTable`'s `annotate_rows` adds new row (**variant**) fields.\n",
    " - `MatrixTable`'s `annotate_entries` adds new entry (**genotype**) fields.\n",
    " - `Table`'s `annotate` adds new row fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above cell, we are adding a new column (**sample**) field called \"sample_data\". This field should be the values in our table `sd` associated with the sample ID `s` in our `MatrixTable` - that is, this is performing a **join**.\n",
